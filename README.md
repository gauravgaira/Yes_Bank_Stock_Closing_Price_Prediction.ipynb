ccurately forecasting the closing price of Yes Bank's stock is a critical challenge for investors, market participants, and stakeholders due to the bank's recent tumultuous history. As a prominent private sector bank in India, Yes Bank has faced significant financial distress, marked by a substantial accumulation of bad loans and allegations of fraudulent activities. This has resulted in regulatory intervention by the Reserve Bank of India, creating an environment of uncertainty and complexity surrounding the bank's stock price trajectory.

This project endeavors to address this challenge by harnessing a comprehensive dataset encompassing monthly stock price information from the bank's inception. The dataset includes essential metrics such as the closing, starting, highest, and lowest prices for each month, providing a rich source of historical data for analysis. The overarching aim is to develop robust predictive models capable of capturing the nuanced dynamics and trends in Yes Bank's stock prices, even in the face of recent adverse events and the associated volatility.

To achieve this, the project will employ a multifaceted approach, leveraging a variety of modeling techniques that include time series models and regression methods. A thorough evaluation will be conducted to assess the efficacy of these models in accurately predicting Yes Bank's closing stock price. Furthermore, the models will be rigorously tested to gauge their ability to incorporate the impact of pivotal events, such as fraud cases involving the bank's founders or regulatory actions taken by the Reserve Bank of India.

The successful prediction of Yes Bank's closing stock price holds the potential to offer invaluable insights to stakeholders, empowering them to make well-informed investment decisions. By navigating the complex and unpredictable nature of Yes Bank's stock performance, this project aims to deepen the understanding of its financial standing and contribute to effective decision-making in the financial markets.
